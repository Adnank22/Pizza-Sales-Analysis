Problem Statement:
Our pizza company needs to optimize sales performance. We will analyze key KPIs like Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order to gain insights into our revenue, customer spending habits, and order quantities.

To visualize these insights, we'll create charts such as daily and monthly order trends, sales distribution by category and size, and performance of top and bottom-selling pizzas. These visualizations will help us identify patterns, peak order times, customer preferences, and underperforming products, enabling us to enhance our sales 
strategies and business performance.
